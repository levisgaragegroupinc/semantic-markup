# <Semantic-Markup>

## Description

This project was built to demonstrate proper use of semantic markup that will improve search engine optimization (SEO).
It was also created to improve accessibility for the visually impaired and screen readers.

The purpose in submitting this project was to learn and practice semantic markup best practices and to add these without alterting the appearance of the existing web page.
